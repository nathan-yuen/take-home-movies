# Notes

- This is my first time building a Next.js app, there might be things that aren't considered best practice for Next
- App was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-next-app)
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) was used for all core UI components
- No explicit error handling if API fails, any `5XX` would render default `_error` page

# Setup

npm install
